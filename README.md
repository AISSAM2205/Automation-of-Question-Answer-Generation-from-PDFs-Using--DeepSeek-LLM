# PDF Insights: Interactive Q&A with DeepSeek API

## Introduction
This project is an interactive Q&A application designed to provide insights from PDF documents. The project uses a large language model, and the DeepSeek API to deliver accurate and 
efficient responses. Users can upload PDF documents, ask questions, and receive relevant answers based on the content of the uploaded PDF.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
- **LangChain**: To manage and orchestrate the language model interactions.
- **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, used for handling embeddings.
- **DeepSeek API**: To leverage advanced computational resources for model inference.
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: For embedding generation and processing.

## Note
The user is not responsible for any type of content produced by the model. The responses generated by the model are based on the provided PDF documents and the capabilities of the underlying language model.
